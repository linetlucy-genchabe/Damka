            </h2>
            <p style="font-family: cambria;">Don Amolo Memorial Kids Ark is a program designed and which is effective when both parent/guardian and child participate in the intervention. It is a self-funded community-based organization which supports children’s club for orphaned and vulnerable children especially children living with HIV and children and families affected by Sickle Cell disease in Butere Sub County, which is a rural community.  The children living with HIV club was launched on the 24th March 2012 at the founder’s parents’ home in Shikunga with the aim to provide social support, increase adherence among kids, give hope and provide life skills to enable these kids live a meaningful life and eventually be who God intended them to be. The Humming Bird warriors was launched in October 2022 with the aim to create a sickle cell registry, establish a clinic where all sickle cell patients would come and receive treatment timeously. The KIDS’ ARK was registered as a community-based organization in 2013, registration No. BTR/DSS/CBO/9356/2013. </p>

        <h3>Club Meetings</h3>
       <p>We hold monthly meetings with kids and caregivers with the aim to: -
        <br>
        Facilitate communication between and within families living with HIV and Sickle Cell Disease.
        <br>
        Reduce the isolation experienced by families.
        <br>
        Provide a recreational and therapeutic environment where children and parents can share their experiences with others in similar circumstances.
        <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">
        <br>
        Provide a venue where information about medical, social and aspects of HIV and Sickle Cell disease can be shared and where new ways of coping can be learned.
        <br>
        Children are supervised by workers and spend their time participating in a range of fun activities whilst parents participate in a workshop program.

          <h3> Exchange Programs</h3>
          <p>We facilitate exchange program with other children’s clubs and whenever possible we also host other children from outside our region. In 2017 we started our OTZ club which helps the children be responsible. Everything they do as long as they are members of the OTZ club entirely depends on them. OTZ means Operation Triple Zero which encourages them to have the three ZEROS which are zero missed drugs, zero missed appointments and zero viral loads these programs help build the kids’ self-confidence and helps in stigma reduction</p>

          <p>We provide free sanitary pads for our young girls to ensure they remain in school throughout the school term. We usually provide them with both reusable and disposable sanitary towels. In August 2017, were issued the reusable sanitary towels and they were so happy. These are replaced yearly as funds become available.</p>

          <h3 >School Feeding Program</h3>
          <p>In 2017, we noticed that most children wasted time going home and getting back to school during lunch hour. Sometimes these children would fail to come to school because they did not have any meal at home and therefore had to work to afford at least a meal a day. We started supporting lunch program for children in primary school to encourage and improve the school performance and reduce absenteeism. </p>

          <h3>Emergency Food for Nutritional Support</h3>
          <p>Most of the families in the region we support are low-income households. Some of the caregivers are either too old or just plain incapacitated to provide for these children. In 2017 we introduced the Emergency nutritional support to some of the most vulnerable kids whose household had poor yields. Here are photos of some of the days that distribution are done.</p>

            <h2 style="color: white;font-weight: bolder;">Our Founder</h2>
        <p style="color: white;">Don Amolo Memorial Kids Ark was born out of a desire to give back to my community and to serve God in the children’s Ministry.  On 24th March 2012 with no funding but with the zeal to touch children’s lives ‘Don Amolo Memorial Kids Ark’ was officially launched at my late parents’ home. Unlike in neighboring counties where CDC and PEPFAR aggressively support the children’s clubs and provide free drugs and laboratory support services to PSC/CCC’s unfortunately that is not the case in Butere, which also happens to be my home. Children living with HIV continue to suffer stigma which leads to poor adherence or non-compliance to ARV’s, which remains the lifeline to their survival. Children’s clubs are merely support groups for kids with HIV which provide a channel to openly and in a friendly atmosphere discuss pertinent issues relating to HIV. Issues are discussed and addressed during sessions which are conducted by qualified volunteer health workers and all children and their caregivers enjoy a hearty meal at the end of each meeting.</p>
