            </h2>
            <p style="font-family: cambria;">Don Amolo Memorial Kids Ark is a program designed and which is effective when both parent/guardian and child participate in the intervention. It is a self-funded community-based organization which supports children’s club for orphaned and vulnerable children especially children living with HIV and children and families affected by Sickle Cell disease in Butere Sub County, which is a rural community.  The children living with HIV club was launched on the 24th March 2012 at the founder’s parents’ home in Shikunga with the aim to provide social support, increase adherence among kids, give hope and provide life skills to enable these kids live a meaningful life and eventually be who God intended them to be. The Humming Bird warriors was launched in October 2022 with the aim to create a sickle cell registry, establish a clinic where all sickle cell patients would come and receive treatment timeously. The KIDS’ ARK was registered as a community-based organization in 2013, registration No. BTR/DSS/CBO/9356/2013. </p>
        <p style="font-family: cambria;">DAMKA supports children living with HIV/AIDS within the age range of 0-18 years as this age group have no support groups.  For the Humming Bird Warriors, it supports all the patients suffering from sickle cell disease and the families that support them. A nursery school was started in May of 2013 and ceased operations due to funds as its purpose was to provide free education to HIV positive children while other children paid a small fee which turned out inadequate to support administrative costs. A mentorship program was started in October 2013 to sensitize secondary school teachers and students about the realities of HIV and hopefully create a safe environment for those living with HIV in institutions of higher learning. This has been a very successful venture. Shikunga being the home of the KIDS ARK it was only fair to start off at the St. Paul’s Shikunga Secondary school which is the school nearest to our office premises. Several schools later sent requests to be included in the program and this we continue to do as funds allow. In 2020, we expanded to Manyala, in April 2022, we moved offices to the Ministry of Agriculture office along Butere-Shiatsala road. In September 2022, we started a DAMKA support group in Khwisero sub county and intend to expand further in the coming years.</p>
