        <h3>Club Meetings</h3>
       <p>We hold monthly meetings with kids and caregivers with the aim to: -
        <br>
        <span>&#8226;</span>
        Facilitate communication between and within families living with HIV and Sickle Cell Disease.
        <br>
        <span>&#8226;</span>
        Reduce the isolation experienced by families.
        <br>
        <span>&#8226;</span>
        Provide a recreational and therapeutic environment where children and parents can share their experiences with others in similar circumstances.
        <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">
        <br>
        <span>&#8226;</span>
        Provide a venue where information about medical, social and aspects of HIV and Sickle Cell disease can be shared and where new ways of coping can be learned.
        <br>
        <span>&#8226;</span>
        Children are supervised by workers and spend their time participating in a range of fun activities whilst parents participate in a workshop program.

          <h3> Exchange Programs</h3>
          <p>We facilitate exchange program with other children’s clubs and whenever possible we also host other children from outside our region. In 2017 we started our Operation Triple Zero(OTZ) club which helps the children be responsible. Everything they do as long as they are members of the OTZ club entirely depends on them. OTZ means Operation Triple Zero which encourages them to have the three ZEROS which are zero missed drugs, zero missed appointments and zero viral loads these programs help build the kids’ self-confidence and helps in stigma reduction</p>

          <p>We provide free sanitary pads for our young girls to ensure they remain in school throughout the school term. We usually provide them with both reusable and disposable sanitary towels. In August 2017, were issued the reusable sanitary towels and they were so happy. These are replaced yearly as funds become available.</p>

          <h3 >School Feeding Program</h3>
          <p>In 2017, we noticed that most children spent excessive time going home and getting back to school during their lunch hour. Sometimes these children would fail to come to school because they did not have any meal at home and therefore had to work to afford at least a meal a day. We started supporting a lunch program for children in primary school to encourage and improve the school performance and reduce absenteeism. </p>

          <h3>Emergency Food for Nutritional Support</h3>
          <p>Most of the families in the region we support are low-income households. Some of the caregivers are either too old or incapacitated to provide for these children. In 2017 we introduced the emergency nutritional support to some of the most vulnerable kids whose household had poor yields. Here are photos of some of the days that distribution are done.</p>

            OAF is a small-scale farming program in which caregivers are enrolled and given incentives to farm and grow themselves as members of the community.
The program is paid in monthly installments as they get to join merry-go-round groups for savings, they help each farmer in the group to plant and harvest during the season.
OAF gives different ranges/types of incentives including mobile phones, fertilizers, seeds, iron sheets, etc.
These activities help farmers save time during planting and they get to work together as a community to improve nutrition and food security.

        The Don Amolo Kids Ark Goats Project is a visionary initiative aimed at ensuring that all children under our care and treatment have access to nutritious goat milk. Recognizing the critical importance of proper nutrition in supporting the health and well-being of orphaned and vulnerable children living with HIV/AIDS and sickle cell disease, we have implemented this project to provide a sustainable source of high-quality milk. By raising goats, we not only ensure a consistent supply of nourishing milk but also empower our children and their families with the skills and resources to become self-reliant. Through the Don Amolo Kids Ark Goats Project, we are committed to promoting the physical health and nutritional needs of our beneficiaries, fostering resilience, and enhancing their overall quality of life. Join us in this transformative endeavor as we work together to make a lasting impact on the lives of these remarkable children.
